•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is looking to create a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It, which they currently have only as an Android app. They want to build a multiplayer game where teams guess what’s being drawn from a collection of stock images. As for the software, they need it to handle multiple teams with several players each, and the names of the games and teams should be unique to avoid any mix-ups. Plus, there should only be one game instance running at any time, using unique IDs for games, teams, and players. Essentially, they want a fun and easy-to-use design for this multiplayer web game.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

While putting together the software design document for the client, I made sure to focus on optimizing the images used as clues in the game and how they would affect memory usage. I laid out a clear structure, which made it easy to navigate through the document, and I addressed crucial requirements like unique team and game names, multi-team support, and game instance management. I explored ways to ensure that the images were lightweight to reduce memory consumption while still maintaining quality, which would help keep the game running smoothly across different devices. This way, players can enjoy a seamless experience without any lag or slowdowns.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document really helped when I was coding. Its clear structure made it easy to see how everything fit together, so I could break down tasks without feeling overwhelmed. The outlined requirements kept me on track with the important features, like making sure team and game names were unique.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work on the software design document, I’d focus on comparing different operating platforms. While I included some basic info about how the game would work across various platforms, I think I could've gone a bit deeper into how performance and user experience might differ from one to another. To improve this section, I’d take a closer look at each platform, like Android, iOS, and web browsers—to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. It’d also be helpful to talk about platform specific stuff, like touch controls, different screen sizes, and how varying network connectivity can play a role. Throwing in examples of how other games adapted to different platforms could really add some value.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I figured out the user’s needs by looking at what the client wanted and thinking about how players would actually use the game to create an enjoyable experience. It’s super important to consider what users want because it really shapes their experience. When they feel like their needs are met, they’re more likely to enjoy the game and come back for more. Keeping user needs front and center helps ensure the final product is cool and engaging, which is key to success.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When I started designing the software, I focused on gathering all the requirements and really understanding what the users needed. I spent time analyzing the game concept and how players would interact with it, which helped me figure out what features were most important. In the future I would stay in line with current techniques and try to get more details from the client and anaylze current reviews/user feedback.
